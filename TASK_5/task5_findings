D18 Task 5 

Task:
The data is available as two attached CSV files:
takehome_user_engagement. csv
takehome_users . csv
The data has the following two tables:
1] A user table ( "takehome_users" ) with data on 12,000 users who signed up for the
product in the last two years. This table includes:
● name: the user's name
● object_id: the user's id
● email: email address
● creation_source: how their account was created. This takes on one
of 5 values:
○ PERSONAL_PROJECTS: invited to join another user's
personal workspace
○ GUEST_INVITE: invited to an organization as a guest
(limited permissions)
○ ORG_INVITE: invited to an organization (as a full member)
○ SIGNUP: signed up via the website
○ SIGNUP_GOOGLE_AUTH: signed up using Google
Authentication (using a Google email account for their login
id)

● creation_time: when they created their account
● last_session_creation_time: unix timestamp of last login
● opted_in_to_mailing_list: whether they have opted into receiving
marketing emails
● enabled_for_marketing_drip: whether they are on the regular
marketing email drip
● org_id: the organization (group of users) they belong to
● invited_by_user_id: which user invited them to join (if applicable).
2] A usage summary table ( "takehome_user_engagement" ) that has a row for each day
that a user logged into the product.

Defining an "adopted user" as a user who has logged into the product on three separate
days in at least one seven­day period, identify which factors predict future user
adoption.

MY FINDINGS:

In this data I could find that to create an adopt user data we can apply clustering  algorithm like kmeans and find on what basis the user logged or on what feature. Where in implementation I find it hard to normalize the visited column of the [takehome_user_engagement] dataset.
I cleaned the [takehome_user] dataset for Nan values. And tried to identify the user_id who has logged sessions with respect to creation_source . but the issue is I’m losing some of the categorical data,
 I think by this way we can predict that if the user shall be adopted in future on basis of their invite i.e.; creation_source 
In this case K value will be 2 (Org_invite and guest_invite) . we shall proceed with the prediction that who has more frequently logged in within a week. For this also I didn’t get an idea to normalize or scale the timestamp variables to implement successfully.
Hence if we shall find the relation between them (On my opinion) we can identify which factors predict future user adoption.
